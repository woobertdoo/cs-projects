# The Projects
***
## CMP SCI 2250: Programming and Data Structures
***
### pig-latin
A basic console application that takes an input string from the user and converts it to "pig latin".
Ex: User inputs "I am a student", output is "Iway amway away tudentsay."

### array-war
This program takes two int arrays of equal length. For each index in the arrays, it checks which array has the larger element
in that index and appends that to a new array. The resulting array will have the larger element from either array for each respective index

### delimiter-checker
A console application that takes a snippet of code and checks for matching braces.

### horse-racing-sim
A basic racing simulator

## CMP SCI 2750: Linux Environment and System Programming

### character-count
A command line tool that will take a given input file, convert it to either all caps or all lowercase, and count occurences of a user-provided character

***
## CMP SCI 3010: Full Stack Web Development
***

***
## CMP SCI 3130: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
***
### polynomial-evaluation
This program is made to compare the efficiencies of three different polynomial evaluation algorithms: the brute force method, Horner's method (factorization), and the repeated squares method.
It also has elements of file i/o.
