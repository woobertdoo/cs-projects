# The Projects

## CMP SCI 2250: Programming and Data Structures

### pig-latin
A basic console application that takes an input string from the user and converts it to "pig latin".
Ex: User inputs "I am a student", output is "Iway amay away tudentsay."

### array-war
This program takes two int arrays of equal length. For each index in the arrays, it checks which array has the larger element
in that index and appends that to a new array. The resulting array will have the larger element from either array for each respective index

### delimiter-checker
A console application that takes a snippet of code and checks for matching braces.

### horse-racing-sim
A basic racing simulator

## CMP SCI 2261: Object-Oriented Programming

### smart-parking
A console-based application meant to mimic a smart parking lot application. It features aspecsts of object-oriented design like classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.

## CMP SCI 2750: Linux Environment and System Programming

### character-count
A command line tool that will take a given input file, convert it to either all caps or all lowercase, and count occurences of a user-provided character

### calcTest
A basic addition program. This program highlights using multiple files, unit testing, and makefiles.

### prime-sums
This program takes an input array and outputs all the pairs of prime numbers that have a sum less than 50. This program highlights usage of process forking.

### shm-sum
This program takes an input array and outputs the first pair of numbers that has a sum of 19. This program highlights usage of shared memory between processes.

## CMP SCI 3010: Full Stack Web Development

### project-1
The first of a sequence of projects in creating a full web application. This iteration includes HTML and CSS.

### dota-quiz-react/dota-quiz-server
These two projects work in tandem to create a full stack version of project-1. This application uses react for the front end and Node.JS, Express, and PostgresSQL 


## CMP SCI 3130: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### polynomial-evaluation
This program is made to compare the efficiencies of three different polynomial evaluation algorithms: the brute force method, Horner's method (factorization), and the repeated squares method.
It also has elements of file i/o.

## CMP SCI 4280: Program Translation Project

### project-p0
The first project in a set of projects used to make a simple compiler. This one takes text input and organizes it into a basic binary tree.
